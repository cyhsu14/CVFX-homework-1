## 1. Training cycleGAN 
The dataset we use is summer2winter_yosemite, and it took about 40 hours to finish the training.

## 2. Inference cycleGAN in personal image
After changing phot othe size to 256x256, I create my own dataset and run the testing command. The first image is to switch summer to winter and the second and third one is winter to summer.  
<img src="./img/myphoto_summer.png" width="400px" />  
<img src="./img/myphoto_winter1.png" width="400px" />  
<img src="./img/myphoto_winter2.png" width="400px" />  

## 3. Compare with other method
